# MCS-51
programming of MCS-51 microcontroller (Keil + Proteus)

working with frequency: 
we get the UART frequency value and generate a 1/3 signal from the UART parameter (
The frequency of the serial port - 4800 |
Shparnist pulses - 1/3 |
Output port - P1.6 |
Parameter accepted by UART - Frequency, kHz )
